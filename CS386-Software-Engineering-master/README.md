SETTING UP DATABASE
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1) make sure xxamp is installed
2) copy files from the repo to directory xxamp is in and then go into htdocs
3) I recommend creating a new folder called whatever you want
4) Enter that folder and paste the files
5) once that is done open xxamp
6) start apache and mySQL
7) paste this into browser first: localhost/*yourfoldername*/createDB.php
8) next paste: localhost/*yourfoldername*/createStreamTables.php
9) finally paste: localhost/*yourfoldername*/updateTables.php
10) Your database should now be setup to use the service.
